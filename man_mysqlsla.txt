       mysqlsla parses, filters, analyzes and sorts MySQL slow, general,
       binary and microslow patched slow logs. It also supports user-defined
       logs.

       This POD/man page is only a very brief outline of usage and command
       line options. For the full library of mysqlsla documentation visit
       http://hackmysql.com/mysqlsla.

       Reading "~/.mysqlsla" is the very first thing mysqlsla does when it
       starts.  Command line options can be set in this file (one per line).
       Example:

       atomic-statements

       statement-filter=+UPDATE,INSERT

       Notice: no leading dashes (- or --), no quotations marks ("), and the
       form "option=value" when "option" requires a value.

       These options are overriden by those given on the real command line.

       "--log-type (-lt) TYPE LOGS"
           Parse MySQL LOGS of TYPE. Default none. TYPE must be either slow,
           general, binary, msl or udl. LOGS is a space-separated list of
           MySQL log files.

           As of mysqlsla v2.03 this option is optional. If given, mysqlsla
           will treat the logs as the given type. If not given, mysqlsla will
           automatically detect the log type by examining the first log file.

           Binary logs are a special case. mysqlsla cannot read MySQL binary
           log directly. You must first "decode" the binary log using
           mysqlbinlog without the --short-form option. It is only the text
           output from mysqlbinlog that mysqlsla can read.

           If you want to use the --short-form option with mysqlbinlog you
           must then use TYPE udl with mysqlsla.

           LOGS can also be - to make mysqlsla read from STDIN. This can be
           used to pipe the output of another program into mysqlsla. However,
           if you use - to read from STDIN, you must explicitly give the log
           type; mysqlsla cannot automatically detect the log type from STDIN.

       "--abstract-in (-Ai) N"
           Abstract IN () clauses further by grouping in groups of N. Disabled
           by default.

       "--abstract-values (-Av)"
           Abstract VALUES () clauses further by removing the number of
           condensed value sets. Disabled by default.

       "--atomic-statements"
           Treat multi-statment groups atomically when filtering. Disabled by
           default.

       "--avg (-n) N"
           Average query timing over N executions. Default 1.

       "--databases (-db) (-D) DATABASES"
           Try EXPLAINing queries which have no known database using
           DATABASES.  Default none. DATABASES is a comma-separated list of
           database names (without spaces). Only used when option explain is
           used too.

       "--db-inheritance"
           Allow queries to inherit the last database specified in the log.
           Disabled by default.

       "--debug"
           Enable a flood of debugging information from both mysqlsla and
           MySQL::Log::ParseFilter. Disabled by default. Use with caution.

       "--dist"
           Calculate distribution frequency of values. Disabled by default.
           Requires an appropriate standard report format line.

       "--dist-min-percent (-dmin) N"
           Do not display dist percents less than N. Default 5.

       "--dist-top (-dtop) N"
           Display at most N dist percentages. Default 10.

       "--dont-save-meta-values"
           Do not save meta-property values from log. Disabled by default
           (meta-property values are saved).

       "--explain (-ex)"
           EXPLAIN each query. Disabled by default. Requires an appropriate
           standard report format line.

       "--extra (-x) TINFO"
           Display extra table information. TINFO can be either tschema,
           tcount or both like tschema,tcount. Default none.

           tschema will cause mysqlsla to print each tables structure (the
           output of SHOW CREATE TABLE).

           tcount will cause mysqlsla to print the number of rows in each
           table using SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table.

       "--flush-qc"
           Flush query cache before query execution timing. Disabled by
           default.

       "--grep PATTERN"
           grep statements for PATTERN and keep only those which match.
           Default none.

           Tells you to see what you are reading right now.

       "--host ADDRESS"
           Connect to MySQL at host ADDRESS. Default localhost if no socket is
           available.

       "--meta-filter (-mf) CONDTIONS"
           Set meta-properties filter using CONDITIONS. Default none.
           CONDITIONS is a comma-separated list of meta-property conditions
           (without spaces) in the form: [meta][op][value].

           [meta] refers to a meta-property name, the list of which is long:
           see mysqlsla v2 Filters.

           [op] is either > < or =. [value] is the value, numeric or string,
           against which the value for [meta] from the log must be true
           according to [op].

           For string-based [meta], like db or host, [op] can only be =.

       "--microsecond-symbol (-us) STRING"
           Use STRING to denote microsecond values. Default Xs.

       "--no-mycnf"
           Do not read ~/.my.cnf when initializing. Does not apply to Windows
           servers.

       "--nthp-min-values (nthpm) N"
           Do not calculate Nth percent values if there are less than N
           values. Default 10.

       "--nth-percent (-nthp) N"
           Calculate Nth percent values. Disabled by default or 95 if used but
           no N is given. Requires an appropriate standard report format line.

       "--password PASS"
           Use PASS as MySQL user password. If PASS is omitted, the password
           will be prompted for (on STDERR).

       "--percent"
           Display a basic percentage complete indictor while timing all
           queries for the time-all report.  Disabled by default.

       "--port PORT"
           Connect to MySQL on PORT. Default none (relies on system default
           which will be 3306).

       "--post-analyses-replay FILE"
           Save a post-analyses replay as FILE.

       "--post-parse-replay FILE"
           Save a post-parse replay as FILE.

       "--post-sort-replay FILE"
           Save a post-sort replay as FILE.

           format.

       "--reports (-R) REPORTS"
           Print REPORTS. Default standard. REPORTS is a comma-separated list
           of report names (without spaces).

           Available reports are: standard, time-all, print-unique, print-all,
           dump.

           WARNING: A safety SQL statement filter of "+SELECT,USE" is
           automatically set when using time-each-query or the time-all
           report. Overriding the safety SQL statement filter by explicitly
           setting another with statement-filter can permit real changes to
           databases. Use with caution!

       "--save-all-values"
           Save extra "all values" for some meta-properties. Disabled by
           default.

       "--silent"
           Do not print any reports. Disabled by default. Debug messages will
           still be printed.

       "--socket SOCKET"
           Connect to MySQL through SOCKET. Default none (relies on system
           default which is compiled into the MySQL client library).

       "--sort META"
           Sort queries according to META. Default t_sum for slow and msl
           logs, c_sum for all others.  META is any meta-property name.

       "--statement-filter (-sf) CONDTIONS"
           Set SQL statement filter using CONDITIONS. Default none. CONDITIONS
           is a comma-separated list of SQL statement types  in the form:
           [+-][TYPE],[TYPE],etc.

           The [+-] is given only once before the first [TYPE]. A + indicates
           a positive filter: keep only SQL statements of [TYPE]. A -
           indicates a negative filter: remove only SQL statements of [TYPE].
           If neither is given, - is default.

           [TYPE] is a SQL statement type: SELECT, CREATE, DROP, UPDATE,
           INSERT, etc.

       "--time-each-query (-te)"
           Time each query by actually executing it on the MySQL server.
           Disabled by default. Requires an appropriate standard report format
           line.

           WARNING: A safety SQL statement filter of "+SELECT,USE" is
           automatically set when using time-each-query or the time-all
           report. Overriding the safety SQL statement filter by explicitly
           setting another with statement-filter can permit real changes to
           databases. Use with caution!

       "--top N"
           After sorting display only the top N queries. Default 10.

       "--udl-format (-uf) FILE"
           Use FILE to define the format of the user-defined log (udl) instead
           of the default. Default is ";\n" record separator and no headers.

       "--user USER"
           Connect to MySQL as USER. Default user of mysqlsla process.

       The standard report is the human-readable report which shows all the
       numbers and values calculated from the log. If no other report is
       specified, it is the default report.

       mysqlsla automatically formats the standard report according to a
       report format depending on the log type being parsed. Therefore, the
       standard report for general logs is different from slow logs and binary
       logs, etc. mysqlsla has, internally, basic report formats for every log
       type, but a custom report format can be explicitly set by using the
       "--report-format" option.

       Read http://hackmysql.com/mysqlsla_reports for more information on
       creating and customizing report formats.

BBUUGGSS
       I follow the zero known bugs release policy in releasing new versions
       of mysqlsla. Certainly, however, bugs still exist somewhere. So when
       you find one, contact me through the web site at
       http://hackmysql.com/contact.
